# 1.Introduction:

Vaccination also is known as immunization is one of the cost-effective methods of disease prevention. Over the past decade, the coverage of vaccination has increased significantly, helping to reduce disease. The global coverage of vaccination has been higher than 80%, but not adequate, according to the WHO.By introducing weakened or killed pathogens, vaccines help us to create an individual's immunity (Vanderslott, Dadonaite and Roser, 2020).

As part of this analysis, we have considered below four vaccines:

1) Bacillus Calmette-Gu√©rin (BCG) vaccine:
It is used for tuberculosis (TB) prevention. This is one of the global region-based WHO's most approved vaccines. It is most widespread in the areas of Latin America, Africa, and Asia. It is the most common disease among homeless people in the United States, so it is limited to specific persons (Cdc.gov, 2020).

2) Measles-containing-vaccine first-dose (MCV1) vaccine:
It is one of the very contagious diseases which is spread through the air.  It is given in the format of two doses. The current coverage of this vaccine is around 86 percent(Cdc.gov, 2020).

3) Inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) vaccine:
It is considered to be a deadly disease caused by the poliovirus.  It is also offered in the Oral vaccine package. The polio vaccine is the highest group vaccine in the global regions during the past decade. This contributed to a 99 percent reduction in paralysis caused by the poliovirus (Cdc.gov, 2020).

4) Yellow fever vaccine (YFV) vaccine:
It is common in the region of Latin America and Africa.  It is transmitted through infected mosquitoes. The current coverage is 49 percent, which is much lower than the criteria predicted (Cdc.gov, 2020).


# 2.Rationale:

In the modern world, where we boast of having the best health care, the deaths due to diseases are still a major concern. As vaccines are being developed for all major diseases, the most important question is whether these vaccines are available to the ordinary people.

# 3.Dataset & variables:

The dataset is obtained from UNICEF database. We have considered four vaccines and is having the data from 1980 till 2018 based on the different regions (UNICEF DATA, 2020).


# 4.Research Question:

How far has the vaccination reached globally?
